 <p id="descr" >&emsp;&emsp; <b>Albert Einstein ( 1879 - 1955)</b> the most recognized scientists and considered the most influential physicist of the 20th century. He is well known for his special and general theories of relativity that proposed revolutionary changes in human concepts of time, space and gravity. He stands behind probably the most famous formula  E = mcÂ² . 

In 1921, Einstein won the Nobel Prize for Physics for explanation of the phenomenon known as the photoelectric effect. 

He worked on many other influential theories and projects including: the deflection of light by gravity, the quantum theory of atomic motion in solids, Brownian motion, an explanation for capillary action and much more.Throughout his life, Einstein published more than 300 scientific and 150 non-scientific papers.</p>
